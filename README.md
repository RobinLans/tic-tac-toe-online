## Tic Tac Toe

For this project the idea was to create a Tic Tac Toe game where you could not only play offline but also against someone else online.

To make the app real-time I used web-sockets and more specifically [socket.io](https://socket.io/) which is probably the most used web-socket library.

This project is based off these [requirements](https://github.com/rickywid/app-ideas/issues/8), which is a brilliant GitHub Repository if you need ideas for your next project
